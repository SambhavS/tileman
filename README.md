# Adventures of Tiler, the Tileman
Tiler is an angsty teen, forever pained by the fact that he lives in a world made solely of tiles. 
In this Pokemon-style game, Tiler walks around endlessly, soothed only by the material comforts of coins, mushrooms, and shoes. 
Future updates may reveal that Tiler's world is more interesting than he thinks.
